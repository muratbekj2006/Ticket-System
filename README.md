- We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage Python dependencies. Please install it first.

- Activate virtual environment, then use this command to install dependencies:

  ```console
  $ poetry install --no-root
  ```

For development, you should install with:

  ```console
  $ poetry install --no-root --with dev,test
  ```
